JSX 
HTML in javascript
JSX compiles down to JS
is easier to write

HTML in JS : Justification
Angular ng-repeat, Knockout, ember uses JS in html. And it is domain specific, like ng repeat is different in diffent frameworks listed above. 

React : Opposite of JS in HTML. Use JS as markup. No need to know domain specific language
